								Hiya, welcome to the About Me page.
								<br>
								I grew up in the city of Norrköping, moved to Stockholm when I was 13 and studied game design in Skövde for 6 years, getting a Bachelor in Game Design and a Master in Digital Narration and Cultural Heritage. 
								Sadly that didn't give me a job. 
								Now I'm back in Stockholm looking for work, but I am open to moving to some other part of Sweden (or even nearby EU countries) where I find a job.
								<br>
								When I'm not working on games or looking for a job I like to read fantasy and sci-fi books, play board games and video games, hike in nature and do some worldbuilding.
								<br>
								The image above is taken from Billingen, a hill nearby Skövde. Nice place to walk to.

									I play a variety of games, but as I mentioned in my initial blurb on the front page and you might guess by the rest of my portfolio, strategy games are my favorite. 
									I like grand strategy games (Eu4, CK3), 4X's (Civ, Stellaris, Age of Wonders), turn based tactics (Xcom, Darkest Dungeon, Baldur's Gate 3), card games (Slay the Spire, Marvel Snap, used to play Hearthstone) and more bite-sized strategy games (Slipways, Terraformers, FTL, Into the Breach). 
									The one main subgenre I wouldn't say I'm a fan of is traditional real time strategy games like Starcraft or Age of Empires, as I find real time games without pause quite stressful. 
									Real time with pause like FTL or Shadow Gambit are cool though. 
									<br>
									Currently I just reformed Asatro in CK3 and completed the first city of The Last Spell

									While I do play a lot of strategy games and Civ 5 is the game I have the most time on steam, its not close to the game I have spent overall the most time on. 
									Let's just say I am glad Minecraft doesn't have have an overall hour count. 
									It's been a while since I played a lot of it, but between different mod packs, servers (both mini game and friendly servers), custom maps and vanilla survival I have put in a lot of hours there. 
									<br>
									Besides Minecraft, some examples of games I've played and liked a lot are Portal 1 and 2, Subnautica and Below Zero, Hades, Katawa Shoujo, Overwatch (though I quit because Blizzard, you know) and the Mass Effect trilogy and Andromeda. 
									<br>
									My favorite non strategy games of all time are Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden west. 
									Fantastic world, characters, and great gameplay. (Please don't make me wait 2 years for the PC port next time Sony)
									I'm not really a Console player, but I also enjoy Mario Kart when I get a chance to play.

									If it wasn't clear already I'm also a big fan of board games. 
									My favorite type of board game are deckbuilders, like Ascension, the Clank! series, Dune Imperium and Dominion.
									In general I've found that I like games that have a lot of different cards, but aren't "just" card games with predefined/player created decks. 
									There is something about figuring out a plan on the fly from an array of cards that is really fun.
									<br>
									I'm a big fan of Res Arcana and 7 Wonders Duel, I want to play more of SETI and Kemet and Civilization A New Dawn... 
									<br>
									I also like smaller games like Tokaido, Tsuro and Codenames. In general, I just like board games.
									Overall, if I had to pick one favorite, it's probably Terraforming Mars, but Dune Imperium and Clank! in Space come close. 
									<br>
									I used to be part of the leadership at Sugs and play board games there (basically) every Tuesday evening, and now since I left Skövde I'm on the hunt for a board game group.

									And of course TTRPG's are great, even if getting together a proper campaign is hard. 
									I have played three characters from roughly level 1 to 5 in DnD fifth edition and they have all been great experiences. 
									Acasez, my online username came from a Lizardfolk Cleric I played in one of those campaigns. 
									I have also DM'd a few different campaigns, in both DND 5e and Pahtfinder (2e). 
									Currenty I am as mentioned designing my own TTRPG, inspired by Pathfinder, which can be found <a href="kastorix.html">here</a>
									<br><br>
									I have also been in a Anima Beyond Fantasy campaign, which was interesting. It had some cool ideas, but also a lot of strange systems and unnecessary complexity.

									I also read a quite a bit, mostly fantasy books. 
									I love interesting worldbuilding and magic systems. 
									Some of my favorite series include The Wandering Inn, Arcane Ascension, Mother of Learning, Riyria, Mistborn and the Shadow Campaigns. 
									I've read some Sci-fi too, and while I prefer fantasy there are good series/books there like The Expanse, Wayfarers and Project Hail Mary.
									<br> 
									Currently I'm reading (and really enjoying) The Aeronaut's Windlass
									<br> <br>
									I also read some manga and fanfics (mostly fluff and canon divergence AU's). 
									I've written Horizon Forbidden West longfic, which can be found <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/45724504">here</a>, which I'm quite happy with.
