								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Physical Characteristics</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin resemble tall, scaled humanoids with distinctive reptilian features, including tails, horns, and neck frills.
									Their scales provide natural armor, and their tails, while smaller than other species like the Yirte, are prehensile enough to help with balance and physical tasks.
									Dragonkin scales come in a variety of muted colors, including deep greens, blues, reds, and golds.
									Their coloration varies widely, sometimes even within the same clan.
									The scales are usually thicker and duller than Naga scales, making them better suited for defense than flashy displays.
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									A rare few dragonkin have scaled wings, a gift granted by an ancient and powerful ritual kept guarded by the Draconium.
									These wings are strong enough to grant flight and are seen as a mark of great honor.
									Since The Breach, more winged dragonkin have appeared, though the ritual remains costly to perform.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Society and Culture</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Community Structure</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin society revolves around their clans, large extended family units, often tied to one or more dragons who serve as protectors and leaders.
									These clans act as the fundamental social, political, and military units of Dragonkin culture.
									Large clans are often led by a dragon while smaller ones might have a clan elder.
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									While most Dragonkin remain in The Draconium, some clans, like Clan Seliax, have ventured beyond their homeland and adapted to life elsewhere.
									They carry their traditions with them, even while living in foreign lands.
									Individual dragonkin also leave the Draconium for personal reasons, either as traders, diplomats, or exiles.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Settlements</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin favor stone and clay over wood, building their cities in defensible positions like mountain passes, cliffsides, or riverbanks.
									Their cities are planned with military efficiency, featuring wide streets, fortified walls, and grand public spaces.
									Their cities boast large statues of dragons and heroes, while their artisans produce finely crafted weapons, armor, and tools that are highly sought after throughout the continent.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The dragonkin have an old polytheistic faith following the seven primordial dragons, however it has little impact on the day to day life of most citizens.
									There are priests and temples in most major cities, but most citizens only visit them on special holy days.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Daily Life and Practices</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Education</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin clans ensure that all children are well-educated, both in practical skills like smithing, crafting, and warfare, as well as in the history and traditions of their people.
									Each clan takes responsibility for educating its young, and many clan leaders see this as the key to maintaining the strength and pride of their people.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Art and Music</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									While dragonkin are best known for their sculpture, they also have a unique musical tradition that emphasizes large, deep-toned instruments, including massive drums and horns.
									Their music is often slow, powerful, and intended to evoke the grandeur and majesty of dragons.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Interaction with Other Species</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin are often seen as proud and, at times, aloof, which can make interactions with other species tense.
									Despite their reserved nature, dragonkin value trade and diplomacy.
									They have established solid trade routes, particularly in the aftermath of The Breach, where they have taken on many refugees.
									Their industrious nature and high-quality goods make them sought-after trade partners.
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin have forged alliances with other nations to resist the Void Creatures, though they are careful to maintain their independence and pride.
									While they prefer to be self-sufficient, they will join forces when necessary to combat mutual threats.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Military and Defense</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Dragonkin generally favor strong, well armored armies with a central chain of command.
									They tend to be proud and patriotic, and respect their armies.
									Before the breach the Draconium’s military was known as one of the strongest on the continent and reinforced by its draconic protectors, it was known to be nearly impossible to defeat.
									30 years after the breach, the Draconium is the only nation on Avigor that hasn’t fallen to the creatures from the void.

						<div class="portfolio-row"> <!-- Magic -->
							<div class="portfolio-text">
								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Magic</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The Dragonkin have previously had fewer and less powerful mages than other nations.
									While they have had magical academies they were less funded than other nations.
									Some have theorized that this comes from the fact that archmages are some of the few true threats to a full grown dragons power, and so Dragonkin have historically not encouraged the practice of magic.
