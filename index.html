								<h2>Hi!</h2>
								<p>
									My name is Edvin Skogsholm Sanne and I'm a game designer from Sweden. I've studied game design and digital narration at Högskolan i Skövde/Skövde University. My main skills lie in gameplay, balance and level design. I have also worked on level design, programming and UI design. I have experience with scripting in Unity and with Unreal Blueprints.<br><br>
									My favorite game genre to both design and play is strategy games, though I can work with most genres. I also really like worldbuilding, especially in fantasy and historical settings.<br><br>
									<a href="https://acasez.itch.io/">https://acasez.itch.io/</a> for all the games I've worked on.<br><br>

								<p>
									Amsvartne is a 2D puzzle platformer I made as part of the start up group Corvian Games (now Tiny Creature Games). It focuses on narrative exploration and puzzle solving using light to navigate levels and solve puzzles. It's set in a mystical mine in a fantasy dieselpunk setting. I worked on the game and level design, as well as programming multiple game systems.

								<p>
									A strategic board game about making a mid sized Swedish city climate neutral. In the game players play cards to build green power, nature areas to absorb pollution and other projects to achieve sustainability, while managing their income and the opinion of people in the municipality.
								</p>
								<p>
									I proposed the original idea for the game and have worked on game design, balance and testing. I worked with Iris Casado, Zoey Wu and Alexander Ros who worked on graphic design and card illustrations.

								<p>
									It has most of the features of physical board game and a inbuilt tutorial. It also the option to be played in either English and Swedish and has options for different amount of starting pollution, to provide different levels of challenge. I made a script that imports the card data using CSV files for quick playtesting and balancing, a method I use in my projects today.

									During the summer of 2024 I had an internship at ION Games, a board game studio, working on playtesting and game design. I helped playtest a variety of games, including Dino Dynasty, Atlas, and Pax Viking Second Edition. I worked with the designers to give feedback on rules, balance and rulebooks. Since then I have been in contact with some of the designers and done occasional digital playtests.

									City State was made for a my Bachelor's Thesis about structure in Tech Trees. It's a fairly short city building game that was made to see how different tech tree structures of tech trees affect the gameplay. It was however still designed to be fun and playable as game game though and I worked on it afterwards to add some juice.

Fantasy world set on a moon orbiting a gas giant, featuring an industrial not-quite roman republic led by dragons fighting off eldritch monsters. It also has airships as the main method of travel, magic that's both a science and art form, humans as a minority species and lot's of lovely magitech.

									After building City State and getting positive feedback on it I wanted to try make another city builder. I've tried to different concepts and while neither have been great successes, they have both taught me a great deal about making games in Unity and making city builders as games. The project also shows more of my design philosophy and methods

Land of the Arcane is a fantasy 4X inspired by Stellaris, Civilization, Age of Wonders and many other games. Still in the planning stages so far.

									It was made with the other team members at Corvian Games (Now Tiny Creature Games). I worked on combat mechanics, and coded in blueprints. It was a nice refresher in working with blueprints, and I would like to do more projects in Unreal at some point.
