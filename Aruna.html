								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The aruna are an intelligent avian species inhabiting the Shattered Isles.
									They live in small nations or clans, often referred to as flocks.
									They have colorful feathers which vary depending on the region they originate from and dexterous wingarms.
									Although aruna wings don’t provide enough lift for sustained flight, they excel at gliding and utilizing natural updrafts to remain airborne.
									The aruna are also adept swimmers, frequently sourcing materials and food from the sea.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Physical Characteristics</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The aruna are slightly shorter than humans on average, with bird-like features.
									Their bodies are covered in vibrant feathers, which they take great pride in maintaining.
									In Aruna culture, gifting a feather is a profound symbol of trust and friendship.
									Adapted to their environment, the Aruna are proficient in both swimming and gliding between the numerous islands and cliffs of the Shattered Isles.
									They possess webbed feet and streamlined bodies, allowing them to swim swiftly and evade many dangers.
									Their gliding ability is particularly useful in navigating the volcanic updrafts and turbulent weather conditions prevalent in the region.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Society and Culture</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Community Structure</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Aruna society is organized into small nations or clans, typically one per island, or multiple for the larger islands.
									These groups, often called flocks, are usually led by an elected leader, though some flocks have alternative forms of governance.
									Every five years, all the flocks gather in a large assembly called The Windsong Conclave.
									This event features extensive debates, an open fair for the exchange of goods, and three days of feasting.
									Flocks bring gifts or goods to the gathering, using it as an opportunity to gain prestige.
									The assembly also serves as a forum to resolve interflock disputes and conflicts.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Settlements</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Aruna settlements are characterized by their vertical architecture, designed to facilitate gliding.
									Despite being constructed in ways some outsiders might consider primitive, their cities feature impressive spires and towers for landing and leaping.
									With limited wood resources on the Shattered Isles, aruna buildings are made from the prevalent basalt-like rock and a compact material derived from processed seaweed and coral.
									Some Aruna structures mimic the ancient ruins scattered across the islands.
									While they cannot replicate the grandeur of the original builders, the Aruna possess the most knowledge and theories about these predecessors, seeing themselves as their stewards.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Economy and Craftsmanship</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The aruna economy is diverse, relying on both marine and terrestrial resources.
									They excel in fishing, underwater foraging, and collecting rare materials from the sea.
									Their craftsmanship includes creating tools and artifacts from volcanic rock, coral, and shells.
									The aruna don’t engage in much trade with other species, being cut off by the stormy sea that surrounds them.
									Most of their trade occurs with the nation of Deshir on eastern Melbor.
									Aruna goods are highly valued for their unique materials, especially the corals and rocks with powerful or unique magical properties that attract alchemists and scholars.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Religion and Beliefs</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The Aruna’s spirituality is deeply connected to their environment.
									They worship elemental spirits of air and water, believing these entities guide and protect them.
									Volcanic activity is both revered and feared, with shamans or spiritual leaders performing rituals to honor and appease the spirits of the volcanoes.
									Some flocks also worship the predecessors who once lived on the Shattered Isles and, according to some legends, caused their shattering.
									They believe they are stewards of the land until these beings return to Kastorix.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The Aruna have one of the most developed public schooling systems on Kastorix, teaching both practical skills such as swimming, gliding, and crafting, as well as cultural traditions and sciences.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Art and Music</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Aruna art reflects their vibrant environment, using natural materials to create intricate works.
									Their music, primarily vocal with rhythmic accompaniment, plays a crucial role in cultural expression and storytelling.
									The aruna have many singers and bards, as well as dancers.
									While few outsiders have seen them, their performances are said to be legendary.

							<div class="portfolio-text">
								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Interaction with Other Species</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The aruna as a species prefer to keep to themselves, both by choice and due to the rough seas surrounding them.
									While they do trade with outsiders who journey to their shores and accept new inventions, they rarely allow them into their homes.
									They maintain a cautious but generally peaceful relationship with other species, preferring to stay out of world affairs.
									This isolation has caused the aruna to lag behind in some technological and magical advancements.
									Whether to send promising spellcasters to Ishyin Academy has been a topic of debate at the last three assemblies.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Though generally peaceful, the aruna are capable defenders of their territory.
									Their natural agility and proficiency in both air and water make them formidable opponents.
									They use their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage, employing guerrilla tactics and surprise attacks.
									The Aruna also practice a unique form of combat that mixes martial arts with magic, often taking opponents by surprise with their agility and precision.
