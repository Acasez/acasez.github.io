							<h3 class="portfolio-title">Physical Characteristics</h3>
							<p class="portfolio-description">
								Trolls are generally broad and bulky, possessing thick, hide-like skin in faded non-human colors, ranging from gray to cyan.
								Their physical features include large tusks and pointed ears similar to those of elves.
								The most famous trait of trolls is their regenerative ability.
								While not as potent as magical creatures like hydras, trolls can heal from large wounds and regenerate fingers over the course of days.
								They can also reattach lost limbs by holding them to the wound.
								However, their hides and regenerative abilities do not work against wounds caused by fire, making it a significant weakness and a revered element in troll culture.
								Troll regeneration is also quite draining and requires a good calorie intake.
								Trolls generally have a poor sense of depth perception, especially at a distance, which makes them prefer close-range communication and combat.
