									Gnomes are a diminutive species of short humanoids, typically resembling shorter humans but often exhibiting a range of unusual hair and eye colors.
									They are known for their strong connection to magic, which grows stronger as they age, unlike most mortal species; however, gnomes cannot be born with an attunement and practice sorcery instead, as they lack mana.
									Gnomes are often seen as eccentric, with many gnomes well past 100 years of age, becoming more eccentric and magical as they age.
									Gnomes are also famous for their contributions to the fields of artifice and alchemy.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Society and Culture</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Community Structure</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Gnome society is often naturally decentralized, split into city-states with separate governments. This allows gnomes to choose cities based on personal preference, as each city often has its unique character or "gnomish".
									Power within these city-states is usually held by councils or elected officials, often composed of elder gnomes, artisans, and scholars.
									The city-states encourage innovation and creativity, with the famous city-state of Theze being a base fabrication hub for the Shattered League.

								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Settlements</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Gnome settlements are often bustling hubs of invention and magical experimentation. They are known for their intricate architecture, combining practical design with whimsical elements.
									Buildings are frequently adorned with mechanical contraptions, enchanted lights, and other magical devices.
									Gnome cities are also known for their southern coast of Aviger, with many cities built to harmonize with their magical and advanced technological landscape.

									They excel in artifice, creating wider ranges of magical devices and automata. Gnomes also thrive in creative fields, like jewelry, pottery, and alchemical trade.
									Their advanced crafting and invention split have made key players in trade, particularly of magical items and advanced technology.

									Few gnomes are religious and their cities have no temples and places of worship. Some gnomes believe in, or at least pay lip service to, Lady Fortune, a traditional manifestation of luck itself.
									Players, since or not, are often seen as important trade deals or new prototype tests.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Interaction with Other Species</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Traditionally, most gnomes lived in their city-states along the southern coast of Aviger. This geographical advantage afforded them more time to escape than other nations when the Breach occurred.
									Some cities, like Straze and Gnomme, are known for their relations with other nations and their governments.
									Gnomes, like humans, are known to adapt well to other cultures and communities, doing trades and making connections.
									Even before the Breach, some gnomes had settled in the southern continent for trade, finding homes in a variety of nations over sizeable minority groups.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Military and Defense</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Gnomes rely heavily on their magical and technical prowess for defense. Their city-states are often protected by intricate magical wards, mechanical guardians, and golem armies.
									The few gnome soldiers that exist are typically equipped with advanced weaponry and magical artifacts, making them formidable opponents despite their small size.
									They favor strategies that emphasize technology and the use of their inventions over brute force.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Magic</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Gnomes are deeply connected to magic, with their abilities growing stronger as they age. 
									Unlike other species, Gnomes cannot be born with an attunement and practice sorcery. 
									Instead, many gnomes become "pseudo-attuned" to elemental magic from their surroundings as they age, giving them a connection similar to an attunement.
									Gnomes are known to be skilled at wizardry and especially artifice. 
									They have made a vast array of magical devices and constructs that aid in daily life, research, and defense. 
									Examples include the airship construction yards of Thune, the defensive golems of Tuln, and the floating lanterns of Tindwyl.
