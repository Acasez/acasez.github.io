								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The subterranean vesper are a species of short humanoids with bat-like wings and claws.
									They primarily inhabit The Caverns Below, the vast cave systems of Kastorix.
									Vespers have the shortest lifespan of the sentient species of Kastorix but are quick learners with excellent memories.
									They are known for their agriculture, knowledge of the caverns and crystal artifice.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Physical Characteristics</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Vespers might be distantly related to the yirte, but they have uniquely adapted to underground life, possessing rudimentary echolocation and eyes that see in darkness.
									Despite their subterranean nature, many vespers dislike enclosed spaces, preferring open areas where they can stretch their wings.
									Vesper flight is silent and efficient, although their wings are on the same limb as their arms, making it difficult to fight while airborne.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Society and Culture</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Community Structure</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Vesper communities are heavily organized with many rules and rituals.
									They tend to be centralized with strong rulers that lead their communities.
									Vespers put high value on rank and status, but also elevate those with great accomplishments.
									Most vesper communities give tribute to one of the two strong vesper powers, the Emerald Empire and the Crimson Spire.
									These two nations and their tribute make up almost all vesper communities.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Settlements</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Vesper have much internal trade between the different caverns, though not between their nations.
									Trade with surface world is rarer, as the Emerald Empire does not seem them worthy of trade.
									Despite living underground vespers rarely work metal, preferring to instead craft out of crystals and gemstones.
									Their crystal artifice makes advanced structures and devices rarely seen in the outside world.
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The Vesper are also known for their specialized agriculture.
									Their cities feature large plantations and farms where they grow fruits and mushrooms.
									These farms are lit by crystals and supplied with water from large aqueducts and canals.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Religion and Beliefs</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The emerald empire has a centralized belief system that worships the emperor and the eternal line.
									This religion has many holy places located in different caves and caverns.
									One of the places is on the surface, on top of a mountain called The Silent Mountain, which is part of the Everglow Mountains on Melbor.
									On specific dates of the year a few pilgrims climb to its top, before quickly returning back under the earth.
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Belief is very strict in the central caverns though further out there are also signs of vesper folk beliefs and shamanism.
									Some vesper worship magical creatures like Xarlar as nature spirits.

								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Art and Music</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Due to the vesper great sense of hearing and location their style of music is different from the species above.
									Their music is often quiet and delicate with subtle tones that can be hard to pick up on without practice.
									When it comes to art vespers often make arts inspired by their surroundings, sculptures and paintings from scenes and creatures in the caves.
									Abstract art is also common, following crystalline patterns and shapes.

						<div class="portfolio-row"> <!-- Interaction with Other Species -->
							<div class="portfolio-text">
								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Interaction with Other Species</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The vespers have little interaction with other species.
									The emerald empire sees itself as the center of Kastorix and rarely deals with other "lesser" nations.
									The crimson spire has some trade with the nations of the surface, but less than one might perhaps expect.
									Unlike the other species the vesper were barely affected by The Breach as the Void Creatures that came through seem disinterested in navigating the underworld.
									They were however forced to reinforce some caves to defend against magical creatures that fled the surface of Avigor.
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									The Vesper also deal with the Shyvarjarna webs that inhabit the caves, trading for silks and potions.
									Vespers have encountered another species in the deep reaches of the caverns, a mysterious insectoid species referred to as the Kilkaz, but so far have found little way of communicating with them.

						<div class="portfolio-row"> <!-- Military and Defense -->
							<div class="portfolio-text">
								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Military and Defense</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Vesper military combine physical combat and magic and use a large amount potions and artifice.
									While they can fly, they cannot fight very well while doing so, leading to agile fighting styles and little use of armor and shields.
									At the same time, the caves systems present unique challenges and options when fighting.
									Earth magic is highly valued for the ability to carve new routes on the battlefields.
