									The Draconium Imperialis is the only surviving nation on Avijor, the northern continent. 
									It is home to almost all of the worlds dragons, as well as most of the dragonkin. 
									The Draconium is an ancient nation formed by draconic clans that stretch back to the times of yore. 
									Since its founding it has been a world power and bastion of stability, wielding a great degree of influence. 
									The most common calendar of the world is the draconic calendar, which starts at the founding of the Draconium. 
									Since The Breach the Draconium has been forced to undergo a lot of changes, to sustain the endless siege from the Void Creatures. 
									The power dynamics between the dragons, dragonkin and other species has shifted.

									<h3 class="portfolio-title">Geography</h3>
									At 1 857 000km² the Draconium is the biggest country in the world by area. 
									Most of the country lies on the eastern part of Avijor, covering the easternmost part of the continent. 
									The large island of Revonia (387 000km²) is also part of the Draconium, lying southwest of the mainland. 
									Most of the Draconium is in a temperate region with mild winters and warm summers. 
									The northern parts of the country and western hills can get chillier, but nation rarely sees significant snowfalls. 
									<br><br>
									Before the Breach the Draconium used to border multiple nations to the west, including the territory owned by the world famed Spears Legacy mercenary company. 
									Since the Breach, the nation now only borders territory conquered by the void. 
									The Draconium has always had an well managed series of walls on the borders, but these have been significantly reinforced and modernized since the breach. 
									<br><br>
									The Draconium's capital and largest city of Mellafier lies on the northeastern coast, but it has many other significant cities over its territory. 
									Revonia is less populated than the rest of the country, with a large forest on the east side of the island. 
									The Shattered Isles are not too far to the east of the Revonia, but the The Galeward lies in-between disrupting trade.
