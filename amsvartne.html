									Amsvartne is a 2D puzzle platformer I made as part of the start up group Corvian Games (now Tiny Creature Games). 
									It focuses on narrative exploration and puzzle solving using light to navigate levels and solve puzzles. 
									It's set in a mystical mine in a fantasy dieselpunk setting. 
									I worked on the game and level design, as well as programming multiple game systems.

									Things I've Worked on:
									<ul class="a">
										<li>Programmed and designed the light mechanic and its interactions with objects like mirrors, crystals and light sensors</li>
										<li>Designed the first level and worked iteratively on many puzzles for it as we figured out how we wanted the game.</li>
										<li>Programmed the respawn and lamp recharge system</li>
										<li>Programming many level design and testing tools to speed up the development process</li>
										<li>Programmed many different puzzle elements like moving platforms, rune puzzles and levers</li>
										<li>Helped with narrative, worldbuilding and the ludo-narrative connection with the puzzles</li>

									During the fall of 2024 we were doing some game jam style quick prototypes to get used to working together and find a cool game concept. 
									Amsvartne, which begun as Escape The Mine, was one of those concepts and was pitched as a narrative focused platformer with a few puzzles, inspired by games like Limbo and Oknytt
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									My first job as game designer was to work on exactly what those puzzles would be and setting up the main mechanics. 
									As it's far easier to say "and we'll add some puzzles here" than it is to actually do that

									City State was made for a my Bachelor's Thesis about structure in Tech Trees. It's a fairly short city building game that was made to see how different tech tree structures of tech trees affect the gameplay. It was however still designed to be fun and playable as game game though and I worked on it afterwards to add some juice.

									After building City State and getting positive feedback on it I wanted to try make another city builder. I've tried to different concepts and while neither have been great successes, they have both taught me a great deal about making games in Unity and making city builders as games. The project also shows more of my design philosophy and methods

							</header>

							<a href="#" class="about-me-image"><img src="images/Sk√∂vdeSlice.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p class="about-me-text">I grew up in the city of Norrk√∂ping, moved to Stockholm when I was 13 and studied game design in Sk√∂vde for 6 years, getting a Bachelor in Game Design and a Master in Digital Narration and Cultural Heritage. Sadly that didn't give me a job. Now I'm back in Stockholm looking for work, but I am open to moving to some other part of Sweden (or even nearby EU countries) where I find a job.</p>
							<p class="about-me-text">When I'm not working on games or looking for a job I like to read fantasy and sci-fi books, play board games and video games, hike in nature and do some worldbuilding.</p>
							<p class="about-me-text">The image above is taken from Billingen, a hill nearby Sk√∂vde. Nice place to walk to. Also you can click on it to go the top of the page</p>
