									Santsim is the smallest continent on Kastorix, located west of Meibor and south of Avijor. 
									It is home to a diverse range of species, including humans, gnomes, nagas, yirte, and brannur. 
									Notably, it also hosts the largest collection of dragonkin and vesper outside of their native lands.

									<h3 class="portfolio-title">Geography</h3>
									Southern Santsim is dominated by a large steppe, where various nomadic tribes roam, most famously the tribes of Quarthax. 
									To the west, the steppe gradually transitions into a vast desert, punctuated by the large, isolated, and mysteriously shaped mountain known as Shadowspire. 
									North of Shadowspire lies the expansive Elsam Desert, which covers much of western Santsim and houses the ancient, secretive nation of El-Shavri, which has stood for millennia.
									<br><br>
									Northern Santsim features a vast mangrove forest, home to the Tharn Commune, a unique and ecologically harmonious society. 
									Below the mangrove forest, in central Santsim, lies the Ashen Lands, a volcanic and geologically active region characterized by its rugged terrain and frequent volcanic activity. 
									This area is both a source of rich minerals and a land of constant danger.
									<br><br>
									To the south of the Ashen Lands and cutting across central Santsim, the Highlands provide elevated plateaus and rugged terrain, rich in dangers and home to ancient fortresses and strongholds. 
									This area gradually transitions into the Savanna, characterized by grasslands with scattered trees and diverse wildlife, supporting unique nomadic tribes with distinct cultures.
									<br><br>
									Eastern Santsim hosts a few smaller kingdoms and the emerging federation of Glarnast, which is beginning to unify the region through trade and diplomatic efforts. 
									This area is characterized by a mix of temperate forests, rolling hills, and fertile valleys, providing a stark contrast to the harsher environments found elsewhere on the continent. 
									On the eastern coast of Santsim lies the Jasman strait with the continent of Meibor on the other side.
