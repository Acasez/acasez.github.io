									<h3 class="portfolio-title">Geography</h3>
									Avijor is the northernmost and largest of the continents on Kastorix. 
									Historically it was composed of many different nations, however after The Breach, only The Draconium remains standing. 
									Before the breach Avijor had a majority human population, with a significant amount of gnomes, brannur, dragonkin and yirte. 
									It also had all of Kastorix's elves before they vanished in the breach.
									<br><br>
									West of the highlands and south of the woods is a fertile grassland which housed many kingdoms and nations. 
									In the central part of the grasslands one can also find the mystical Saryo Forest which held many giant mushrooms and magical creatures. 
									The grassland stretches to the south part of the continent were the climate grows warmer and hillier again. 
									Before the breach the southern part of Avijor was dominated by a group of powerful city states, primarily populated by gnomes which was the center of artifice before the breach.
									<br><br>
									On the eastern part Avijor, beyond Spear's Legacy sits the only surviving nation on the continent, the Draconium. 
									Home to almost all the worlds dragons they hold back the darkness that has befallen the rest of the continent. 
									South of the Draconium lies the The Charged Lands, a rocky area known for its lightning magic after a magical comet hit it a many hundred years ago. 
									The charged lands is known for its magical flora and fauna that adapted for life there.
