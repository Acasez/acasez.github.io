								Spells are cast by performing a Spellshaping Check, against a DC that is based on the spells rank and tratis. 
								The spellcaster rolls a D20 and adds their INT and DEX, and if they get above or euqal to Spellshaping DC they succed at casting the spell.
								Craetures rolling against the spell roll against the result of the spellshaping check. 
								<br><br>
								Generally on a failed spellcasting nothing happens, but some spells have effects that take place.
