									Sapients is the term used for all intelligent species that inhabit Kastorix. The total population of sapients is estimated to be around 250 million, scattered across the three continents, countless islands, and deep subterranean realms, among 9 species. 
									Before The Breach which consumed most of the northern continent of Avijor, this number was far higher.
									Historically, the term "humanoid" was used to classify sapient species, but with the decline of human dominance, this term has fallen out of favor. 
									Today, "sapient" is the preferred term, which broadens the definition to include species such as dragons and coatls, who were previously not categorized as humanoids.
