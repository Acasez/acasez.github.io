									I designed a board game for the municipality of Mariestad with graphics by Iris Casado, Wu Deyu, Alexander Ros and others. 
									The game is a eurogame inspired by games like Terraforming Mars however the game is designed to be fairly short and easy to learn. 
									The game can be played with 2-4 players and its playtime varies on the amount of players. 
									2 experienced players can play it in under 25 minutes, but for 4 new players can take about hour and half. 
									<br>
									The goal of the game is to have the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game, in 2030. 
									The main way to get VP is by reducing pollution which can be done in a variety of different ways. Some of those ways include, producing renewable power, reducing car traffic and building green areas to absorb CO². During the game players take the role of an actor in the city, like a company or organization. 
									They then play different project cards, while managing their economy and relations with the people of the municipality. 
									<br>
									The game takes place over 7 years, as part of the Viable Cities climate neutral 2030 strategy. 
									At the end of the 7 years the player player with the most Victory Points wins and hopefully Mariestad is Climate neutral. 
									<br>
									The game is now printed and can be be played in Mariestad and at Högskolan i Skövde. 
									I have also done an online singleplayer version that can be played here

									Things I've Worked on:
									<ul class="a">
										<li>Programmed and designed the light mechanic and its interactions with objects like mirrors, crystals and light sensors</li>
										<li>Designed the first level and worked iteratively on many puzzles for it as we figured out how we wanted the game.</li>
										<li>Programmed the respawn and lamp recharge system</li>
										<li>Programming many level design and testing tools to speed up the development process</li>
										<li>Programmed many different puzzle elements like moving platforms, rune puzzles and levers</li>
										<li>Helped with narrative, worldbuilding and the ludo-narrative connection with the puzzles</li>
									</ul>

									During the fall of 2024 we were doing some game jam style quick prototypes to get used to working together and find a cool game concept. 
									Amsvartne, which begun as Escape The Mine, was one of those concepts and was pitched as a narrative focused platformer with a few puzzles, inspired by games like Limbo and Oknytt
								</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									My first job as game designer was to work on exactly what those puzzles would be and setting up the main mechanics. 
									As it's far easier to say "and we'll add some puzzles here" than it is to actually do that

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									After some early testing one of the key elements of the game we identified was light, both as a concept and main mechanic. 
									The player, called Kol, finds a helmet with a light source and can use it to solve puzzles.
									The light mechanic also gave me as the designer a lot of ideas and concepts to make puzzles with. 
									I designed puzzle elements like mirrors, lenses, crystals, light sensors and magical dark areas which I think could make for very cool puzzles.

									I also wrote most the code for our note system when we switched from using fungus. 
									The system stores notes (and dialogue while we had it) using scriptable objects. 
									It has a scriptwriter effect that causes letters to appear letter by letter, and a button to skip to the end of the note. 
									<br>
									I also used textMeshPro style sheets to have icons display in the the texts.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									To help test the game and new features we were developing I also made a testing toolkit script for the player. 
									It features the variables seen to the side as well as keys for teleporting between checkpoints and summoning the camera to the player. 
									Having a toolkit like this helped speed level design and testing a lot, and I will prioritize making one for future projects. 
									From speaking with Ellis who worked on sound design for the game, he also seemed to have really appreciated the feature.
