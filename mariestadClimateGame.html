									I designed a board game for the municipality of Mariestad with graphics by Iris Casado, Wu Deyu, Alexander Ros and others. 
									The game is a eurogame inspired by games like Terraforming Mars however the game is designed to be fairly short and easy to learn. 
									The game can be played with 2-4 players and its playtime varies on the amount of players. 
									2 experienced players can play it in under 25 minutes, but for 4 new players can take about hour and half. 
									<br><br>
									The goal of the game is to have the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game, in 2030. 
									The main way to get VP is by reducing pollution which can be done in a variety of different ways. Some of those ways include, producing renewable power, reducing car traffic and building green areas to absorb CO². During the game players take the role of an actor in the city, like a company or organization. 
									They then play different project cards, while managing their economy and relations with the people of the municipality. 
									<br><br>
									The game takes place over 7 years, as part of the Viable Cities climate neutral 2030 strategy. 
									At the end of the 7 years the player player with the most Victory Points wins and hopefully Mariestad is Climate neutral. 
									<br><br>
									The game is now printed and can be be played in Mariestad and at Högskolan i Skövde. 
									I have also done an online singleplayer version that can be played here

									Things I've Worked on:
									<ul class="a">
										<li>Pitched the original idea to the municipality; a strategic board game about reducing pollution and building sustainably</li>
										<li>Worked on and tried out early concepts with Iris.</li>
										<li>Designed game mechanics and tested them</li>
										<li>Led many different test sessions with different groups, both skilled board game players and people not used to playing board games. Collected feedback from game tests</li>
										<li>Implemented feedback from test sessions. Worked iteratively on card and game balance.</li>
										<li>Talked with the people at Mariestad on how to best present different topics and themes.</li>
										<li>Helped Iris and Zoey with reference images and feedback for card illustrations and graphical design.</li>
										<li>Made a tool in Unity to compose the cards easier.</li>
										<li>Worked with the printing company (Spelkortsförlaget) to get the right outlines and margins for the cards and boards to print them.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Made a digital solo version of the game to be playable online.</li>

									The project began when Mariestad looked for a project that related to their work on climate sustainability. 
									I pitched the idea of a strategic board game and they liked the idea. At the start of the project it was me and Iris working on the project, with assistance from Lars Vipsjö at Högskolan i Skövde. 
									We started with rough paper concepts and turned that into what you see now. 
									During the project we invited Wu Deyu to help work on card illustrations and Alexander Ros to work on art for the actor cards. 
									I also talked with some other students at Högskolan i Skövde who provided guest art on a few different cards.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									I used the game as my artifact for my (1 year) master thesis on representation of technology and technological development in board games which can be found here. (Its in English)

									The core part of the game is the project cards. 
									While there are standard actions that can always be undertaken, playing project cards is vital to winning the game.
								</p>
								<p class ="portfolio-description">
									There are 106 project cards in the game with differing effects, costs and requirements. 
									At the start of the game each player draws 4 projects cards. 
									Players get 2 more card draws each year and can draw new card from card effects and synergies. 
									Players can also sell to for money per card or trade in two cards for to draw a new card. 
									These effects help mitigate the effect of random card draws and provide interesting decisions during play.
								</p>
								<p class ="portfolio-description">
									The games card based design allows it to highlight a variety of different concepts and ideas and increases the games replayability. 
									Personally I love designing new cards for games, to try to find ways to model different concepts and ideas with the games core mechanics. 
									At one point there were 150 cards in the game, but we had to cut some so that we would have time get illustrations for all of them.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									I also wrote most the code for our note system when we switched from using fungus. 
									The system stores notes (and dialogue while we had it) using scriptable objects. 
									It has a scriptwriter effect that causes letters to appear letter by letter, and a button to skip to the end of the note. 
									<br>
									I also used textMeshPro style sheets to have icons display in the the texts.

								<p class="portfolio-description">
									To help test the game and new features we were developing I also made a testing toolkit script for the player. 
									It features the variables seen to the side as well as keys for teleporting between checkpoints and summoning the camera to the player. 
									Having a toolkit like this helped speed level design and testing a lot, and I will prioritize making one for future projects. 
									From speaking with Ellis who worked on sound design for the game, he also seemed to have really appreciated the feature.
