									The yirte are a small, furry, intelligent species that resemble ferrets or squirrels but have no direct connection to them.
									Yirte are bipedal with fluffy fur, large tails, and sharp claws. They possess an excellent sense of balance and are skilled climbers.
									Yirte are most common on Medior, but prior to the Breach, they lived on all three continents.
									Traditionally, they kept themselves in close-knit communities, such as Skyreach and Narrei.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Physical Characteristics</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Yirte stand 1.0-1.4 meters tall and walk on their back legs, though they can run on all fours when young.
									Their fur ranges from blond to black with a range in color similar to human hair.
									Their claws make them good at climbing and digging in loose soil. Unlike the ferrets and squirrels they somewhat resemble, yirte are omnivores.
									Yirte have a good sense of smell, which they can use to detect threats or food.

								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Community Structure</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Yirte communities are typically ruled by a council of elders, and they are often self-sufficient, producing most of what they need locally.
									They tend to care collectively for all their members, with sensitivity being a common measure of rank.
									Many yirte live their entire lives in the communities where they were born.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Settlements</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Stereotypically, yirte live in hollows and treehouses, harmonizing with nature.
									Yirte cities are built over generations, working in tandem with the natural environment.
									They construct treehouses in jungles, carve out holds in cliffs, and build lodgings in cities.
									The traditional yirte lifestyle can vary greatly, as they are also able to adapt to new technologies and social changes.
									These days, yirte can be found in growing cities of larger nations such as Theze and Thune.

									Yirte are known for their traditional crafts and resourcefulness, often recycling and reusing material to live in areas where might struggle.
									Yirte communities trade with each other and with outsiders, selling fine crafts, alchemy products, rare ingredients, and materials.
									They sometimes buy metals and manufactured goods that can be crafted in their cities from other nations.

								<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Art and Music</p>
								<p class="portfolio-description">

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Interaction with Other Species</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									While generally welcoming to travelers, for outsiders life in yirte communities can be difficult for years before and after the Breach as new lands were settled and new inventions created.
									Some yirte who felt like they didn't belong have started moving to the cities of other nations in search of work and opportunities.
									Since the Breach brought a wave of refugees and settlers to Medior, the amount of interactions has increased again and some isolated communities deep in the jungles and forests found themselves talking to outsiders for the first time in a long while.

								<h3 class="portfolio-title">Military and Defense</h3>
								<p class="portfolio-description">
									Yirte communities are known for being peaceful, but they will fight furiously when defending and known for their guerilla tactics. 
									Yirte are good at stealth tactics and using ranged weapons. 
									They sometimes use poisons and alchemical weapons in warfare and hunting.
									Some yirte communities are less peaceful and wars, while rare, do occur between them. 
									These wars can be quite brutal as yirte expect all capable members to join in the fighting.
